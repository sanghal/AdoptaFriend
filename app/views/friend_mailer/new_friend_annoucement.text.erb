I've just listed you as one of my friends.  I am sure you are deeply honored, as you should be.

Remember the Klingon proverb regarding friends:

  may'Daq jaHDI' SuvwI' juppu'Daj lonbe' 
  (When a warrior goes to a battle, he does not abandon his friends.)

Don't forget about me when you go into battle -- I will not forget you.
